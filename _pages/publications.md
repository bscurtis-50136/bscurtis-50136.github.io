### The Cost of Clarity: Tradeoffs to Public Investments in Rural Diagnostic Care (JMP)
**Abstract.** Rural hospitals face significant financial barriers to adopting advanced medical technologies, creating healthcare quality disparities between rural and urban areas. This paper examines the efficiency-access trade-off in rural healthcare technology adoption by studying the impact of 3D-mammography (3DM) adoption on patient access, utilization, and welfare. Using a 2017 Georgia policy that provided generous subsidies to rural hospitals, I use a difference- in-differences design with rural hospitals in other southern states as controls identify the causal effect of the policy on technology adoption. These estimates imply that subsidization increased the probability of 3DM adoption at rural Georgia hospitals by 20 percentage points from 2017-2019, reducing average rural patients’ distance to the nearest 3DM provider by 30-miles. I then exploit the resulting variation in patients’ geographic access to 3DM to estimate a structural model of demand for breast cancer screenings, which shows that patients have strong preferences for 3DM technology and are willing to travel an additional 25 miles round-trip to access it. The availability of 3DM at a patient’s nearest hospital increases the probability of 3D-screening by 46 percentage points, leading to a 66% increase in 3DM utilization in rural areas. Welfare analysis reveals that 3DM expansion generated $157,000 in additional welfare, representing a 26% social return on investment. However, these effects vary substantially across hospitals: adoption at facilities located far from existing providers with moderate-to-large screening populations generates the largest gains, while adoption in extremely low-density areas can reduce welfare due to high fixed costs relative to patient volume. Counterfactual simulations suggest that targeted allocation rules focusing on horizontally differentiated hospitals in sufficiently populated areas maximize welfare. These findings suggest that strategically targeted investments in rural healthcare infrastructure can promote access high-quality rural healthcare services without sacrificing cost-efficiency.

### Investing in Access: The Impact of Hospital Subsidies on Healthcare Supply in Rural Areas 
**Abstract.** Rural hospitals receive a significant portion of their revenue from government subsidies. However, we know little about how rural hospitals use government funds, as prior research has focused exclusively on urban and suburban hospitals. In this paper, I assess how rural hospitals allocate government subsidy dollars as well as the impacts of increased subsidization on rural hospital profitability and access to care in rural communities. I exploit variation arising from a Georgia policy that sharply increased subsidies to rural hospitals and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare outcomes of rural Georgia hospitals to rural hospitals in other southern states before versus after the policy change. Using financial data from Medicare cost reports, I find that rural hospitals invest subsidy dollars in physical capital. Rural hospitals put 75-cents of every additional subsidy dollar into fixed assets like medical equipment and facilities. After making these investments, rural hospitals house new diagnostic imaging tools and see increased utilization of inpatient services. With higher patient volumes, subsidized hospitals earn higher profits from medical operations. These results suggest that rural hospitals respond to increased subsidization by making investments in physical capital that bolster profits and increase access to care in rural communities.
