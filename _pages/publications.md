### The Cost of Clarity: Tradeoffs to Public Investments in Rural Diagnostic Care [**JMP**](/files/JMP_Curtis.pdf){: .btn .btn--small} 
 
 **Abstract**: Rural hospitals face persistent financial constraints that limit investment in advanced medical technologies, creating disparities in health care quality between rural and urban areas. This paper examines the cost-access trade-off associated with deploying expensive diagnostic equipment in rural markets by studying the diffusion of 3D-mammography (3DM) technology for breast cancer screening in Georgia. I exploit quasi-exogenous variation in rural 3DM supply generated by a state subsidy program that increased adoption rates by 20 percentage points. Using patient-level screening records from 2016--2019, I find that 3DM adoption increases the conditional probability of receiving a 3DM-screening by 45 percentage points, primarily through substitution from 2D-mammography. Distance significantly affects technology choice: being one mile further from the nearest 3DM provider reduces the probability of receiving a 3DM-screening by 0.08 percentage points, though this sensitivity varies with patient risk factors and socioeconomic status. I estimate a structural model of screening demand to quantify welfare effects, finding that rural 3DM investments generated \$0.45 in total surplus per dollar invested. Counterfactual simulations reveal substantial heterogeneity across hospitals. Targeting investments toward more remote hospitals with sufficient local populations maximizes social returns by reducing socially redundant business stealing while ensuring technology deployment at economically viable scale.

### Investing in Access: The Impact of Hospital Subsidies on Healthcare Supply in Rural Areas 
**Abstract.** Rural hospitals receive a significant portion of their revenue from government subsidies. However, we know little about how rural hospitals use government funds, as prior research has focused exclusively on urban and suburban hospitals. In this paper, I assess how rural hospitals allocate government subsidy dollars as well as the impacts of increased subsidization on rural hospital profitability and access to care in rural communities. I exploit variation arising from a Georgia policy that sharply increased subsidies to rural hospitals and estimate difference-in-differences models that compare outcomes of rural Georgia hospitals to rural hospitals in other southern states before versus after the policy change. Using financial data from Medicare cost reports, I find that rural hospitals invest subsidy dollars in physical capital. Rural hospitals put 75-cents of every additional subsidy dollar into fixed assets like medical equipment and facilities. After making these investments, rural hospitals house new diagnostic imaging tools and see increased utilization of inpatient services. With higher patient volumes, subsidized hospitals earn higher profits from medical operations. These results suggest that rural hospitals respond to increased subsidization by making investments in physical capital that bolster profits and increase access to care in rural communities.
