**Job Market Paper:** The Cost of Clarity: Tradeoffs to Public Investments in Rural Diagnostic Care
- **Abstract**: Rural hospitals face significant financial barriers to adopting advanced medical technologies, creating healthcare quality disparities between rural and urban areas. This paper examines the efficiency-access trade-off in rural healthcare technology adoption by studying the impact of 3D-mammography (3DM) adoption on patient access, utilization, and welfare. Using a 2017 Georgia policy that provided generous subsidies to rural hospitals, I use a difference- in-differences design with rural hospitals in other southern states as controls identify the causal effect of the policy on technology adoption. These estimates imply that subsidization increased the probability of 3DM adoption at rural Georgia hospitals by 20 percentage points from 2017-2019, reducing average rural patients’ distance to the nearest 3DM provider by 30-miles. I then exploit the resulting variation in patients’ geographic access to 3DM to estimate a structural model of demand for breast cancer screenings, which shows that patients have strong preferences for 3DM technology and are willing to travel an additional 25 miles round-trip to access it. The availability of 3DM at a patient’s nearest hospital increases the probability of 3D-screening by 46 percentage points, leading to a 66% increase in 3DM utilization in rural areas. Welfare analysis reveals that 3DM expansion generated $157,000 in additional welfare, representing a 26% social return on investment. However, these effects vary substantially across hospitals: adoption at facilities located far from existing providers with moderate-to-large screening populations generates the largest gains, while adoption in extremely low-density areas can reduce welfare due to high fixed costs relative to patient volume. Counterfactual simulations suggest that targeted allocation rules focusing on horizontally differentiated hospitals in sufficiently populated areas maximize welfare. These findings suggest that strategically targeted investments in rural healthcare infrastructure can promote access high-quality rural healthcare services without sacrificing cost-efficiency.
