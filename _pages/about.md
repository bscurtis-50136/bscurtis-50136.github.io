**Job Market Paper:** The Cost of Clarity: Tradeoffs to Public Investments in Rural Diagnostic Care [**Link**](/files/JMP_Curtis.pdf){: .btn .btn--small} 
 
 **Abstract**: Rural hospitals face persistent financial constraints that limit investment in advanced medical technologies, creating disparities in health care quality between rural and urban areas. This paper examines the cost-access trade-off associated with deploying expensive diagnostic equipment in rural markets by studying the diffusion of 3D-mammography (3DM) technology for breast cancer screening in Georgia. I exploit quasi-exogenous variation in rural 3DM supply generated by a state subsidy program that increased adoption rates by 20 percentage points. Using patient-level screening records from 2016â€“2019, I find that 3DM adoption triples local utilization of the technology, primarily through substitution from 2D-mammography. Distance significantly affects technology choice: being one mile further from the nearest 3DM provider re duces the probability of receiving a 3D-screening by 0.08 percentage points, though this sensitivity varies with patient risk factors and socioeconomic status. I estimate a structural model of screening demand to quantify welfare effects, finding that rural 3DM investments generated $0.95 in total surplus per dollar invested. However, counterfactual simulations reveal substantial heterogeneity across hospitals. Targeting investments toward more remote hospitals with sufficient local populations maximizes social returns by reducing socially redundant business stealing while ensuring technology deployment at economically viable scale.
